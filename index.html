  <h1>Combatting Stress for Students</h1>
  <h2>Relaxation Tips</h2>
  <p>Exam Season can be extremely stressful. It's important to remember to slow down, stop what you're doing when you start to feel panicky, and breathe.
    <ul>
      <li>Do some breathing exercises: Inhale for 5 seconds, exhale for 7 seconds. Remember to inhale properly, your stomach should expand.</li>
      <li>Get some fresh air. Sometimes all you need is a change of scenery. Take a 5 minute walk or go for a run. </li>
      <li>Try some meditation, yoga or tai chi.</li>
      <li>Take a moment to do something else. Perhaps detach from technology and read a book.</li>
    </ul>
  <p>It's important to remember during moments of high stress that a healthy body helps to keep your mind healthy. Healthy eating is essential (click the link below to find some quick, healthy recipes to get you through this stressful season). It's also essential to take part in some exercises. Even if it's only for 10/15 minutes a day.</p
