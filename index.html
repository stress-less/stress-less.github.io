  <h2>Relaxation Tips</h2>
  <p>Exam Season can be extremely stressful. It's important to remember to slow down, stop what you're doing when you start to feel panicky, and breathe.
    <ul>
      <li>Do some breathing eercises: Inhale for 5 seconds, Exhale for 7 seconds. Remember to inhale properly, your stomach should expand.</li>
      <li>Get some fresh air. Sometimes all you need is a change of scenery. Take a 5 minute walk or go for a run. </li>
      <li>Try some meditation, yoga or tai chi.</li>
      <li>Take a moment to do something else. Perhaps detach from technology and read a book.</li>
    </ul>
